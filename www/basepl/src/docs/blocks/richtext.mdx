## Installation

```bash
npx @basepl/cli add BaseplRichText
```

Currently, basepl doesn't automatically update the payload types. So if you install the configuration and the component you have to update the types.\
Simply run

```bash
pnpm generate:types
```

If not you will get an error in the BaseplRichText/Component.tsx file. Because the BaseplRichTextType is not present.

## Admin Preview

This is the pre-configured admin panel for the rich text editor block.
You can change it to your needs in the `BaseplRichText/Config.ts` file.

## Options

The Rich Text Editor is a really powerful tool. If you have no experience with it check out the official [rich-text @payload](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/rich-text).

This Rich Text Editor simply extends the lexicalEditor from payload. This is the editor with the most features already included. We added the BaseplButton, BaseplImage and BaseplVideo to the editor. So you can easily add these blocks to your text.
So you could design an entire website with this editor.

We would recommend overwrite the configuration for your use case. It might be best to not include all properties.

## Code

This is the code, if you don't want to use the cli you could copy it from here.

But here are 2 example images. With the rendered final result and the content in the admin panel.
