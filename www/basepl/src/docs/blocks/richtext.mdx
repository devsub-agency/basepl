## Installation

You can add the pre-configured richtext elements to your project with the command below. If you only want to install the richtext block check the reference [here](/docs/getting-started).

<CommandPreview
  npmCommand={'npx @basepl/cli add BaseplRichText'}
  pnpmCommand={'pnpm dlx @basepl/cli add BaseplRichText'}
/>

Currently, basepl doesn't automatically update the payload types. So if you install the configuration and the component you have to update the types.
Simply run

<CommandPreview
  npmCommand={'npm generate:types'}
  pnpmCommand={'pnpm generate:types'}
/>

If not you will get an error in the `blocks/BaseplRichtext/Component.tsx` file. Because the BaseplImageType is not present.

## Richtext block configuration

Here is the result in the admin panel and the pre-configured richtext block itself. You can change it to your needs in the `block/BaseplRichtext/config.ts`file.

<BlockPreview name="BaseplRichtext" imagePath="richtext-preview-dark.png" />

## Richtext component configuration - optional

Per default the richtext block will be installed with prebuild and fully customizable component. To only install the richtext block read more [here](/docs/getting-started).

The basepl richtext act as a wrapper for the richtext-lexical, to apply admin configurations. You can change it to your needs in the `blocks/BaseplRichtext/Component.tsx`.

<ComponentPreview componentName="BaseplRichtext" />

If you want to find out more about the richtext and configuration
options, take a look at the documentation at [lexical.dev](https://lexical.dev/).

## Pre-Configured richtext options

You can customize or extend the richtext component and block as you wish. By default, the rich text is designed for simple blog articles.

### Basic features

These features make rich text editing easier with a fixed toolbar and an inline toolbar.

### Blocks

In the richtext block itself you can define features and further blocks that you want to use. You can display blocks within the component by the JSXConverter function.
