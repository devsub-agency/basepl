## Installation

```bash
npx @basepl/cli add BaseplVideo
```

Currently, basepl doesn't automatically update the payload types. So if you install the configuration and the component you have to update the types.
Simply run

```bash
pnpm generate:types
```

If not you will get an error in the BaseplVideo/Component.tsx file. Because the BaseplVideoType is not present.

## Admin

This is the pre configured admin panel for the video block.
You can change it to your needs in the `BaseplVideo/Config.ts` file.
