## Installation

You can add the pre-configured video elements to your project with the command below. If you only want to install the BaseplVideo block check the reference [here](/docs/getting-started).

<CommandPreview
  npmCommand={'npx @basepl/cli add BaseplVideo'}
  pnpmCommand={'npx @basepl/cli add BaseplVideo'}
/>

Currently, basepl doesn't automatically update the payload types. So if you install the configuration and the component you have to update the types.
Simply run

<CommandPreview
  npmCommand={'npm generate:types'}
  pnpmCommand={'pnpm generate:types'}
/>

If not you will get an error in the `blocks/BaseplVideo/Component.tsx` file. Because the BaseplImageType is not present.

## Video block configuraton

Here is the result in the admin panel and the pre-configured video block itself. You can change it to your needs in the `blocks/BaseplVideo/config.ts`file.

<BlockPreview name="BaseplVideo" imagePath="admin-button.png" />

## Video component configuration - optional

Per default the video block will be installed with prebuild and fully customizable component. To only install the video block read more [here](/docs/getting-started).

The basepl video act as a wrapper for the nextjs video tag, to apply admin configurations. You can change it to your needs in the `blocks/BaseplVideo/Component.tsx`.

<ComponentPreview sampleName="video-loop-silent" componentName="BaseplVideo" />

If you want to find out more about the video tag and configuration
options, take a look at the documentation at [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_video.asp).

## Predefined video options

If you want to include an video, you can `upload` one or choose one from the media collection. You can also choose between different video options.

### Size

You can `select` between different sizes. If you select the option "custom" you can set either absolute width and height or relative width via `input` fields.

<Badges label="Size" text="Fill,Custom" />
<Badges label="Absolute width" text="true,false" />
<Badges label="Width" text="absolute value,relative value" />
<Badges label="Height" text="absolute value" />

### Object settings

If you choose the "custom" option, you can define the object fit and position using the `select` fields.

<Badges label="Object fit" text="Cover,Contain,Fill" />
<Badges label="Object position" text="Top,Bottom,Left,Right,Center" />

### Player settings

You can check the `checkbox` if you want to enable the specific player settings.

<Badges label="Control panel" text="true,false" />
<Badges label="Autoplay" text="true,false" />
<Badges label="Loop sequence" text="true,false" />
<Badges label="Muted audio" text="true,false" />
