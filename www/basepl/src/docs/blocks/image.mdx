## Installation

You can add the pre-configured image elements to your project with the command below. If you only want to install the image block check the reference [here](/docs/getting-started).

<CommandPreview
  npmCommand={'npx @basepl/cli add BaseplImage'}
  pnpmCommand={'npx @basepl/cli add BaseplImage'}
/>

Currently, basepl doesn't automatically update the payload types. So if you install the configuration and the component you have to update the types.
Simply run

<CommandPreview
  npmCommand={'npm generate:types'}
  pnpmCommand={'pnpm generate:types'}
/>

If not you will get an error in the `BaseplImage/Component.tsx` file. Because the BaseplImageType is not present.

## Image block configuraton

Here is the result in the admin panel and the pre-configured image block itself. You can change it to your needs in the `BaseplImage/config.ts`file.

<BlockPreview name="BaseplImage" imagePath="admin-button.png" />

## Image component configuration - optional

Per default the image block will be installed with prebuild and fully customizable component. To only install the image block read more [here](/docs/getting-started).

The basepl image act as a wrapper for the nextjs image tag, to apply admin configurations. You can change it to your needs in the `BaseplImage/Component.tsx`.

<ComponentPreview sampleName="image-default" componentName="BaseplImage" />

If you want to find out more about the next js image tag and configuration
options, take a look at the documentation at [next
image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image).

## Predefined image options

If you want to include an image, you can `upload` one or choose one from the media collection. You can also choose between different image options.

### Size

You can `select` between different sizes. If you select the option "custom" you can set either absolute width and height or relative width via `input` fields.

<Badges label="Size" text="Fill,Custom" />
<Badges label="Absolute width" text="true,false" />
<Badges label="Width" text="absolute/relative value" />
<Badges label="Height" text="absolute value" />

### Object settings

If you choose the "custom" option, you can define the object fit and position using the `select` fields.

<Badges label="Object fit" text="Cover,Contain,Fill" />
<Badges label="Object position" text="Top,Bottom,Left,Right,Center" />

### Priority

You can check the `checkbox` if you want to prevent lazy loading for this image.

<Badges label="Priority" text="true,false" />
