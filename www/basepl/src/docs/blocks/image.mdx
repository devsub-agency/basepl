title: Image 
description: Basic and reusable Image block using the media collection. 
---

## Installation

```bash
npx @basepl/cli add BaseplImage
```

Currently, basepl doesn't automatically update the payload types. So if you install the configuration and the component you have to update the types.
Simply run
```bash
pnpm generate:types
```

If not you will get an error in the BaseplImage/Component.tsx file. Because the BaseplImageType is not present.

## Configuration

This is the config file for the button.

<ConfigPreview name='BaseplImage' description='A basic reusable block for the media collection only handling images.' />


## Example

How to present an awesome profile picture.

<ComponentPreview name='image-default' description='A basic reusable block for the media collection only handling images.' />
