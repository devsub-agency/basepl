## Installation

You can add the pre-configured button to your project with the command below. If you only want to install the button block check the reference [here](/docs/getting-started).

<CommandPreview
  npmCommand={'npx @basepl/cli add BaseplButton'}
  pnpmCommand={'npx @basepl/cli add BaseplButton'}
/>

Currently, basepl doesn't automatically update the payload types. So if you install the configuration and the component you have to update the types.
Simply run

<CommandPreview
  npmCommand={'npm generate:types'}
  pnpmCommand={'pnpm generate:types'}
/>

If not you will get an error in the BaseplButton/Component.tsx file. Because the BaseplButtonType is not present.

## Button block configuraton

Here is the result in the admin panel and the pre-configured button block itself.
You can change it to your needs in the `BaseplButton/config.ts` file.

<BlockPreview name="BaseplButton" imagePath="admin-button.png" />

## Button component configuraton - optional

Per default the block will be installed with prebuild and fully customizable components. To only install the button block read more [here](/docs/getting-started).

The basepl button act as a wrapper for the shadcn button component, to apply admin configurations.
You can change it ether to your needs in the `BaseplButton/Component.tsx` file or in the `components/ui/button.tsx` file.

<ComponentPreview sampleName="button-default" componentName="BaseplButton" />
