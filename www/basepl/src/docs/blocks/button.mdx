## Installation

You can add the pre-configured button to your project with the command below. If you only want to install the button block check the reference [here](https://basepl.com/docs/getting-started).

<CommandPreview
  npmCommand={'npx @basepl/cli add BaseplButton'}
  pnpmCommand={'npx @basepl/cli add BaseplButton'}
/>

Currently, basepl doesn't automatically update the payload types. So if you install the configuration and the component you have to update the types.
Simply run

<CommandPreview
  npmCommand={'npm generate:types'}
  pnpmCommand={'pnpm generate:types'}
/>

If not you will get an error in the BaseplButton/Component.tsx file. Because the BaseplButtonType is not present.

## Block configuraton

Here is the result in the admin panel and the pre-configured button block itself.
You can change it to your needs in the `BaseplButton/Config.ts` file.

<ConfigPreview name="BaseplButton" imagePath="admin-button.png" />

## Component configuraton (optional)

The basepl button act as a wrapper for the shadcn button component, to apply admin configurations to the shadcn ui button.
You can change it ether to your needs in the `BaseplButton/Component.tsx` file or in the `components/ui/button.tsx` file.

<ComponentPreview name="button-default" componentName="BaseplButton" />
