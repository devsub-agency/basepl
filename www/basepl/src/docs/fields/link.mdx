## Predefined link options

You can set your target, a label and also choose between different link options. Per default you can `select` between 4 different targets.

### Label

You can define the label of the link through the `text` field.

### Targets

With the target type "Page" you can either `select` a page from the page collection or enter a custom `text `slug by checking the `checkbox` "Use slug instead".

<Badges label="Page" text="id,text" />
<br />

The target type "Email" allows you to enter an email address via the `text` field. It has a simple validation for email addresses.

<Badges label="Email Adress" text="text" />
<br />

The target type "External" allows you to enter an external link via the `Text` field and also to set some options for the referrer and target type via `Checkboxes`.

<Badges label="External URL" text="text" />
<Badges label="Open in new tab" text="true,false" />
<Badges label="No referrer" text="true,false" />
<br />

"File Download" allows you to link to files. You can use `upload` or select a file from the Media collection.

<Badges label="File Reference" text="upload" />
