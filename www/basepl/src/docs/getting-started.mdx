## Installation

How to install basepl and develop your payload projects in hours not in days. 

### Requirements

You need the following things to be present and configured. 

1. Payload in version 3.0.0 or higher. 
2. Payload Project: It doesn't matter if you have a new project or an existing project. If you don't know to start check out the [Payload Documentation](https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation).
3. Tailwind CSS: Basepl is using Shadcn/ui for styling. This need Tailwind CSS. If you don't have it installed yet, check out the [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

4. **Optional** Shadcn/ui: If you don't have it installed yet, basepl will ask if you want to install it during the init process. 

### Command

```bash 
npx @basepl/cli init
```

## Options 

You can decide if you only want the config *.ts files or also the unstyled components. If you don't have shadcn/ui, you can only add the config files.

```bash
npx @basepl/cli init --config
```

## Good to know
Yet we don't provide collections. We are working on it.
In this time check out our code or the official payload templates if you have no collections yet. The most important is the media collection for images and videos.
