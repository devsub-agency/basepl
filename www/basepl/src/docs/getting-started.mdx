      We are currently in early stage. Properties, structures and naming
      conventions may differ in the near future. If you would like to provide

## Prerequisites

You need the following things to be present and configured.

    <span>
      In addition to blocks, you can also use pre-built components. These
      optional components act as wrappers for the shadnc/ui components. All
      components can be installed either from the command line or by copying
      them into your project manually.

  }

1. Payload project: It doesn't matter if you have a new project or an existing project. If you don't know to start check out the [Payload Documentation](https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation).
2. We recommend that you use Payload version 3.0.0 or higher and keep the default structure (collections, blocks, fields) to use the installation commands.

3. **Optional** - Tailwind CSS: Basepl components rely on Tailwind CSS for styling.
   If you don't have it installed yet, check out the [Tailwind CSS
   Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

4. **Optional** - Shadcn/ui: If you don't have it installed yet, basepl will ask if you want to install it during the init process.

## Install blocks & components

By using this install command you get the `*/config.ts` as well as the `*/Component.tsx` files. Note that this also requires prerequisites 3 and 4. If you don't have shadcn/ui installed, basepl will ask if you want to install it.

<CommandPreview
  npmCommand={'npx @basepl/cli init'}
  pnpmCommand={'npx @basepl/cli init'}
/>

## Install blocks only

If you want to use only the `*/config.ts` files throughout the project, add the `--config` flag to the command.

<CommandPreview
  npmCommand={'npx @basepl/cli init --config'}
  pnpmCommand={'npx @basepl/cli init --config'}
/>

## Good to know

Yet we don't provide any templates or collections.
In this time check out our code or the official payload templates if you have no collections yet. The most important is the media collection for images and videos.

      IN PROGRESS - We are working on a template/starter kit, where you can get
      started easily without thinking about any prerequisites.

We welcome early feedback and ideas from the [Discord

steps.
