          In addition, we inform you below about the third-party components we
          use for optimisation purposes and to increase the quality of use,

        <h2>II. Rights of users and data subjects</h2>
        <p>
          With regard to the data processing described in more detail below,
          users and data subjects have the right to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            to confirmation as to whether data concerning them is being
            processed, to information about the processed data, to further
            information about the data processing and to copies of the data (cf.
            also Art. 15 GDPR)
          </li>
          <li>
            to rectification or completion of incorrect or incomplete data (see
            also Art. 16 GDPR)
          </li>
          <li>
            the immediate erasure of the data concerning them (see also Art. 17
            GDPR) or, alternatively, if further processing is required in
            accordance with Art. 17 para. 3 GDPR, the restriction of processing
            in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR
          </li>
          <li>
            to receive the data concerning them and provided by them and to
            transfer this data to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20
            GDPR)
          </li>
          <li>
            to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority if they believe
            that the data concerning them is being processed by the provider in
            breach of data protection regulations (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition, the provider is obliged to inform all recipients to whom
          data has been disclosed by the provider of any correction or deletion
          of data or the restriction of processing that takes place on the basis
          of Articles 16, 17 para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not
          apply if this notification is impossible or involves a
          disproportionate effort. Notwithstanding this, the user has a right to
          information about these recipients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users and data subjects also have the right to object to the future
          processing of data concerning them in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR,
          provided that the data is processed by the provider in accordance with
          Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data
          processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permitted.

        <h2>III. Information on data processing</h2>
        <p>
          Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked
          as soon as the purpose of storage no longer applies, the deletion of
          the data does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations
          and no other information is provided below on individual processing
          procedures.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>Contact enquiries / contact option</h3>
        <p>
          If you contact us via the contact form or email, the data you provide
          will be used to process your enquiry. The provision of the data is
          necessary for processing and answering your enquiry – without it we
          cannot answer your enquiry or can only answer it to a limited extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your data will be deleted if your enquiry has been conclusively
          answered and the deletion does not conflict with any statutory
          retention obligations, such as in the case of any subsequent contract
          processing.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>Server data</h3>
        <p>
          For technical reasons, in particular to ensure a secure and stable
          Internet presence, data is transmitted to us or to our web space
          provider by your Internet browser. With these so-called server log
          files, the type and version of your Internet browser, the operating
          system, the website from which you have switched to our Internet
          presence (referrer URL), the website(s) of our Internet presence that
          you visit, the date and time of the respective access and the IP
          address of the Internet connection from which our Internet presence is
          used are collected, among other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data collected in this way is stored temporarily, but not together
          with other data about you.
        </p>
        <p>
          This storage takes place on the legal basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f)
          GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability,
          functionality and security of our website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data will be deleted after 6 months at the latest, unless further
          storage is required for evidence purposes. Otherwise, the data is
          excluded from deletion in whole or in part until an incident has been
          finally clarified.

        <h3>Google Fonts</h3>

        </p>
        <p>
          In order to enable the display of certain fonts on our website, a

          website is accessed.
