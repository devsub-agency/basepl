# Roadmap for basepl 

This project was created because of two main reasons: 

1. We at devsub wanted a way to reuse our own payload components 
2. We wanted to make it in a way, that everyone can contribute and use it. 

Yet we don't have a fixed road map. If you have any needs and wishes let us know, via X, bsky or here on github. 

We plan to extend the amount of blocks and fields until the end of january 2025. 
We also plan to release complete templates for different use cases. This will be a collection of blocks, fields, plugins and everything you need to start but nothing more. But here we are still working on a plan how to make the cli experience as easy as possible.
